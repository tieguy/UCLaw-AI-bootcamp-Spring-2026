# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository is an **active coordination space** for developing an AI bootcamp for law students at UC Law, Spring 2026. The instructors (Luis and Zoe) and their AI agents collaborate here to plan and refine the course.

## What's Settled

- **Format**: 6-8 session bootcamp, clinic-style (hands-on, project-based)
- **Target audience**: Law students with no technical or coding background
- **Core goal**: Prepare lawyers to use AI effectively and ethically in practice

### Instructors

- **Luis Villa**: In-house/transactional counsel perspective; contract review, drafting tools, playbook/template systems
- **Zoe Dolan**: Appellate clinic practitioner (Public Counsel, Los Angeles); AI literacy, multi-agent workflows, practice management tools

### Shared Themes

Both instructors emphasize:
- Experiential, hands-on learning over lecture
- Ethics and professional responsibility (CA Rule 1.1 competence)
- Practical AI tool evaluation and use
- Building judgment about when AI is/isn't appropriate

## What's Still Open

See `TODO.md` for action items and `open-questions.md` for unresolved decisions.

Early proposals from each instructor are in `early-ideation/` — these are starting points for discussion, not final plans.
