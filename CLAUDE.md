# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository is an **active coordination space** for developing "Building AI-Enabled Lawyers," a half-semester bootcamp at UC Law for Spring 2026. Two instructors (Luis and Zoe) and their AI agents collaborate here to plan and refine the course.

## Important Context

**This is a work in progress.** Many elements described in planning documents are proposals under discussion, not final decisions. In particular:
- Course structure (number of sessions, sequence, content) is not yet firm
- Project designs are evolving
- Guest speaker involvement is being coordinated

When working in this repository, treat planning documents as living drafts open to revision, not settled specifications.

## Course Vision

The goal is to develop lawyers who can:
- Use AI as practical tools beyond basic chat interfaces
- Exercise judgment about when AI is/isn't appropriate
- Participate in technology decisions at their firms
- Integrate technical capability with ethical obligations

Target audience: Law students with no technical or coding background.

## Instructors

- **Luis**: In-house/transactional counsel perspective; contract review, drafting tools, template systems
- **Zoe**: Co-instructor (role details to be added)
