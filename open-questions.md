## Open Questions to Resolve

### Pedagogical
- What role should programming/automation play? Code writing or just evaluation?
- How to keep current given rapid AI development?
- Is there a role for design thinking?
- Mental health considerations in ethics discussions?

### Practical
- Should we use Claude specifically or be tool-agnostic?
- How to handle different tool access levels (free vs. paid)?
- What's the backup plan if certain practitioners can't participate?
- How much prep time does Luis realistically need for each session?

### Institutional
- Relationship to existing legal tech courses?
- Can this count toward any certificate or specialization?
- Opportunities for cross-listing with other departments (e.g., CS, business)?
