# Questions for Discussion — AI Bootcamp Planning Call

These represent the most significant differences between Zoe's and Luis's proposals that need resolution before we can finalize the syllabus.

## 1. Technical Prerequisites & Theoretical Depth

**The tension**: Zoe's proposal includes "basic applied math and technical exposure" as a learning outcome, references Coursera AI/ML math courses, and emphasizes understanding "what generative and agentic AI actually are and how they work." Luis's proposal explicitly states "no coding skills required or taught" and focuses on practical tool use without theoretical grounding.

**Question for discussion**: How much conceptual/technical foundation should students have? Is there a middle ground—like "intuition without math"—that serves the practical goals while giving students enough mental models to adapt as tools evolve?

## 2. Multi-Agent Coordination: Core Skill or Advanced Topic?

**The tension**: Zoe lists "multi-agent coordination, management and optimization" as a core skill alongside response verification and workflow development. Luis's proposal focuses primarily on single-tool evaluation and playbook design, with multi-agent work implicit rather than explicit.

**Question for discussion**: Is multi-agent coordination (orchestrating multiple AI systems together) essential for day-one practitioners, or is it an advanced topic that risks overwhelming students who are still learning to use individual tools effectively? Where does it fit in the progression?

## 3. Practitioner Involvement vs. Instructor-Led Sessions

**The tension**: Luis's proposal allocates 4 of 8 sessions to practitioner guests, seeing external voices as essential to grounding the course in real-world practice. Zoe's proposal is more instructor-driven with emphasis on hands-on labs and conceptual sessions.

**Question for discussion**: What's the right balance? Too many guests risks fragmentation and logistical complexity; too few risks an academic tone disconnected from practice realities. Are there specific practitioner perspectives that are non-negotiable?

## 4. Duration & Intensity

**The tension**: Zoe proposes a compressed 4-6 day/week bootcamp format. Luis proposes a half-semester (8 sessions) clinic-style format with more time between sessions for projects.

**Question for discussion**: Given UC Law's scheduling constraints and student workloads, which format better serves the learning goals? A compressed bootcamp creates intensity and focus but less time for experimentation between sessions. A longer format allows iteration but risks losing momentum.

## Secondary Questions (if time permits)

- **Capstone scope**: Should Project 4 include a formal presentation/demo, or is written justification sufficient?
- **Tool specificity**: Should we standardize on specific tools (e.g., Claude) or remain tool-agnostic?
- **Refresh mechanism**: How do we plan for curriculum updates given how fast AI is evolving?
