# AI-Enabled Lawyer Bootcamp: Project Planning & TODOs

## Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Confirm duration and scheduling constraints
- [ ] Discuss key pedagogical questions (see `discussion-questions-2025-12-03.md`)

### Practitioner Involvement (Optional Enhancements)

Guest speakers are supplements to the core instructional spine, not prerequisites. If available and aligned with specific sessions, consider:

- [ ] Law Firm CTO/Innovation Director — could reinforce Session 3 (practice operations, vendor evaluation)
- [ ] Litigator — could reinforce Session 4 (discovery, research, privilege realities)
- [ ] In-House/Transactional Counsel — could reinforce Session 4 (contract review, drafting)
- [ ] Ethics/Risk Counsel — could reinforce Session 6 (privilege, conflicts, competence)

### Curriculum Development
- [x] Develop high-level week-by-week outline for discussion with Zoe and Tal → `integrated-syllabus-discussion-draft.md`
- [x] Identify key pedagogical tensions to resolve → `discussion-questions-2025-12-03.md`
- [ ] Design specific project assignments with rubrics
- [ ] **Decide**: Should Project 1 be a single mandatory assignment (everyone does access-to-justice evaluation) rather than offering multiple tracks? The A2J approach brings rich discussion points around UPL, privacy, methodology (RAG vs. reasoning), and real-world impact—having everyone work on the same problem may deepen class discussion compared to fragmented tracks.

### Resources and Materials
- [ ] Contact Owen Astrachan (Duke) about computational thinking materials
- [ ] Curate reading list for students who want to go deeper
- [ ] Identify AI tools to use in tool evaluation exercises
- [ ] Gather sample law firm checklists/playbooks for encoding

### Administrative
- [ ] Determine grading approach (pass/fail vs. other)
- [ ] Establish facility requirements
- [ ] Plan for curriculum refresh process given rapid AI evolution
- [ ] Confirm list of AI tools available through the school (e.g., Harvey.ai)
- [ ] Consider how to handle tool access/licensing for students
- [ ] Set up course infrastructure (collaboration tools, etc.)
