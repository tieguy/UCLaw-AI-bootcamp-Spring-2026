> This document is an AI-aided synthesis of the early proposals from Luis Villa and Zoe Dolan (see `early-ideation/`). It is intended as a starting point for discussion, not a final syllabus. Key open questions are documented in `discussion-questions-2025-12-03.md`.

### Course Overview

This bootcamp prepares law students to be the first generation of AI-enabled lawyers. Students will move beyond basic chatbot interactions to develop practical skills for evaluating, deploying, and building AI-augmented workflows—while integrating ethics and professional responsibility from day one.

**Format**: 6 sessions over the spring semester
**Schedule**: Jan 23, Jan 30, Feb 13, Mar 13, Mar 20, Apr 10
**Prerequisites**: No formal prereqs. Must be willing to experiment and have comfort with ambiguity.
**Grading**: Pass/fail to encourage experimentation

### Session 1: Foundations & Model Literacy
*Jan 23 · Instructors: Luis & Zoe*

- What lawyers actually do with AI beyond prompting
- Model literacy: how AI tools work, why they fail on edge cases and matters of first impression
- Training data, distributions, and generalization — building intuition for when tools are likely to struggle
- CA Rule 1.1 competence: model literacy as professional obligation
- Different models, different "personalities": why cross-model comparison matters
- **Project 1 assigned**: Tool evaluation exercise (compare 2+ models on same task) — due Session 2

### Session 2: Computational Thinking & Playbook Design
*Jan 30 · Instructor-led · Project 1 due*

- Computational thinking: breaking legal processes into steps an AI can execute
- From human checklists to machine-readable instructions
- The gap between documentation and automation — what's implicit in human workflows
- Preparation for Project 3: how to structure work for AI execution
- **Project 2 assigned**: Encode an existing law firm checklist/playbook for an LLM — due Session 3

### Session 3: Practice Operations & Tool Selection
*Feb 13 · Project 2 due*

- Evaluating vendors when dozens of tools claim similar capabilities
- Build vs. buy decision-making
- Client intake, matter management, and workflow tools
- Vendor/data risk considerations
- **Project 3 assigned**: Design a new AI-augmented workflow — due Session 4

*(4-week gap for midterms)*

### Session 4: Litigation & Transactional Applications
*Mar 13 · Project 3 due*

- Discovery, research, motion practice tools (litigation perspective)
- Contract review, drafting, and template systems (transactional perspective)
- Hallucination detection and verification workflows
- Project 3 workshop: discuss workflow designs, share approaches

### Session 5: Building Robust AI Workflows & Capstone Launch
*Mar 20 · Instructor-led*

- Prompt engineering and context design for legal work
- Multi-step workflows and orchestration patterns
- Cross-model comparison as "AI peer review": using multiple models to critique, cross-check, and get unstuck
- Quality control: verification workflows, "human in the loop"
- **Project 4 (Capstone) assigned**: Strategic decision exercise — presented Session 6

*(3-week gap for spring break)*

### Session 6: Ethics, Strategy & Capstone Presentations
*Apr 10 · Project 4 presentations*

- Privilege and confidentiality with AI tools
- Conflicts in shared tools/data
- Duty of competence in AI-augmented practice
- Student presentations: Project 4 strategic decisions
- Reflective self-assessment
