### Course Overview

This bootcamp prepares law students to be the first generation of AI-enabled lawyers. Students will move beyond basic chatbot interactions to develop practical skills for evaluating, deploying, and building AI-augmented workflows—while integrating ethics and professional responsibility from day one.

**Format**: 6 sessions over 6 weeks (hybrid of both proposals)  
**Prerequisites**: None required. Willingness to experiment and comfort with ambiguity.  
**Grading**: Pass/fail to encourage experimentation
