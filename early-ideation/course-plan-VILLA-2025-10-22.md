# Building AI-Enabled Lawyers: Bootcamp Planning Document

## Student Pitch
You will be part of the first wave of AI-enabled lawyers. You will use AI from the moment you enter the practice, and this course will help give you the hands-on experience to wield AI confidently, effectively, and ethically.

## Vision
The goal is to develop lawyers who can:
- Go beyond "chat" to turn AI into useful tools for their practice and co-workers
- Know when AI is-and isn't-the right tool to use
- Have the confidence to weigh in on and shape technology decisions within their firms and companies
- Integrate technical capability with ethical obligations from day one

These will be the lawyers who can be pragmatic implementers on day one, and grow to become trusted decision-makers.

## Course Duration and Structure
I propose a half-semester. Structured more like a clinic than a seminar—hands-on, project-based.

## Student Prerequisites

**Who is this for?**
- No technical background required
- No coding skills required or taught
- No specific career path required (useful for anyone entering modern legal practice)

**What students need:**
- Willingness to experiment with tools hands-on
- Comfort with learning-by-doing and some ambiguity
- Interest in understanding how technology will shape their practice

## Pedagogical Goals

Students should develop:

**Technical Confidence**
- Ability to evaluate AI tools and vendors critically
- Understanding of when to use pre-built tools vs. custom playbooks
- Comfort with iterative development and "good enough" solutions
- Capability to specify requirements and evaluate technical proposals

**Tactical Judgment**
- Which processes are worth formalizing into something an LLM can do (eg, which playbooks get used a lot, which don't)
- Smart evaluation and selection of tools (the "CTO" skillset for smaller practices)

**Ethical Intuitions**
- Privilege and AI
- Duty of competence in AI-augmented practice

## Practitioner Involvement
People we could/should involve:
### A Law Firm CTO/Innovation Director
- Purpose: this is a rare time when technical change has given lawyers a diversity of technical choices (instead of the default of a handful of big providers). Lawyers are terrible at picking tools, and young lawyers may be able to help.
- Evaluation frameworks: how to assess vendors when 50 tools claim similar capabilities
- Questions lawyers should ask before bringing tools to IT
- Build vs. buy decision-making

### A Practicing Litigator
- Focus on: discovery/e-discovery, research, motion practice, case strategy tools
- Real talk about what works, what's overhyped, where the privilege risks are

### In-House+Transactional Counsel
(That's Luis)
- Contract review and drafting tools
- Template and playbook systems

### Ethics/Risk Counsel
- Real-world privilege issues in tool selection
- Competence obligations
- Conflicts in shared tools/data
- Factor to consider: is there a mental health angle?

## Course Structure: 8 Sessions

This is extremely Minimum Viable Course, could be halved or rearranged - it is more to start a conversation than anything else.

**Session 1: Going Beyond Chat**
- Assume students have all done basic chat
- What are programmers doing with LLMs to brainstorm, plan, and execute on plans?
- How can those translate to the practice? Examples from Luis's practice
- Introduction to Project 1: Tool evaluation exercise

**Session 2: Guest - Law Firm CTO/Innovation Director**
- How to assess vendors and tools
- Build vs. buy decision-making
- Questions lawyers should ask IT

**Session 3: Computational Thinking & Playbook Design**
- Breaking down legal processes into steps
- From human checklists to executable instructions
- Introduction to Project 2: Encoding existing playbooks

**Session 4: Guest - In-House/Transactional Counsel**
- Contract review and drafting tools
- Template and playbook systems
- Practice management and workflow automation

**Session 5: Building Custom Processes**
- Prompt engineering for legal work
- Document analysis and review automation
- Introduction to Project 3: Design a new playbook

**Session 6: Guest - Litigators on AI in Practice**
- Discovery, e-discovery, research tools
- What works, what's overhyped
- Privilege and confidentiality in AI systems

**Session 7: Strategic Decisions**
- When to use existing tools vs. custom playbooks vs. commissioned software
- Leading technical change in legal organizations
- Introduction to Project 4: Strategic decision exercise

**Session 8: Guest - Ethics/Risk Counsel & Wrap-up**
- Duty of competence with AI tools
- Real-world privilege and conflicts issues
- Project 4 discussions/presentations

## Project Structure
3-4 smaller experimental projects. Goal is "learn by getting hands dirty in realistic scenarios" rather than "demonstrate mastery." Should be "vibeable"—students can probably do something quick and dirty quickly, but motivated students should be able to go very deep.

   - **Project 1**: Tool evaluation exercise—compare 2-3 AI tools on a real task, document tradeoffs
   - **Project 2**: Encode an existing law firm checklist or playbook for an LLM—revealing the gap between human process documentation and executable instructions (Luis example: encoding Ken Adams' Manual of Style for Contract Drafting; could source other examples from practitioner guests)
   - **Project 3**: Design a new agent playbook from scratch for a repetitive legal task
   - **Project 4**: Strategic decision exercise—given a complex workflow, decide whether to use existing tool, create custom playbook, or commission software. Justify the decision considering costs, capabilities, and ethical constraints.

   Projects would focus on:
   - Real problems from legal practice (potentially sourced from practitioner guests)
   - Experimentation and iteration
   - Practical tool evaluation and use
   - Learning from what works *and what doesn't*
   - Building repeatable processes, not one-off solutions
   - Developing judgment about which processes are worth the investment
   
   Possible formats:
   - Ungraded/pass-fail to encourage experimentation; feedback from Luis or practitioners
   - Peer collaboration highly encouraged—legal practice is almost always collaborative
   - Brief reflection/documentation rather than formal deliverables
   
## Questions for Discussion with Tal

- What does the ideal length look like given your institutional constraints and student engagement patterns?

- Any suggestions on how to balance breadth (exposure to many tools/approaches) vs. depth (real competence in a few areas)?

- What happens if Luis's job situation changes? What's the latest we can propose/pull out? (Luis will know more next week.)
