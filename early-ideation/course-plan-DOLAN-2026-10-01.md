**Course satisfies writing requirement?**  **Yes               No**

(All students are required to complete a substantial writing project under faculty supervision prior to graduation. This requirement may be satisfied either by successful completion of a qualifying seminar or a 2-unit independent study project. In both cases, the professor must certify that the student's paper fulfills the writing requirement. In seminars, a grade of C or better (JDs) or P or better (MSLs) is required. To constitute a substantial writing project, a paper must be a substantial research project that demonstrates professional and scholarly proficiency in research, analysis, and writing. Papers will typically contain approximately 7,000 words, exclusive of footnotes/endnotes, and must thoroughly discuss and resolve the issue(s) considered. Students must receive topic approval from the instructor and submit at least one preliminary draft, upon which the instructor shall provide comments and suggestions. For more information, see Academic Regulation 703.)

# **Course satisfies Experiential Course requirement?**  **Yes               No**

Beginning with the class of 2019, all students must take (and earn a grade of C or better in) at least six units of experiential coursework. ***If you would like your course to qualify as experiential, please read further and answer the questions below*****.**

An experiential course must be *either* a clinic, a field placement course, or a simulation course. In a *clinic*, all students work on live clients’ (or disputants’) cases under the supervision of the faculty who teaches the accompanying academic course. In a *field placement* course, students work on live clients’ (or disputants’) cases under the supervision of an attorney at an outside law office. In a *simulation course*, students work on simulated cases (based or adapted from actual cases) and their lawyering performances are observed and critiqued by the instructor of the course.

To qualify as experiential, a simulation course, clinic, or field placement course must meet the following requirements:

* The course must be *“primarily experiential.”* The majority of class minutes must be dedicated to the experiential component. “The experiential nature of the course should . . . be the organizing principle of the course, and the substantive law or doctrinal material that is part of the course should be incidental to it, not the other way around.” More than 50% of the course grade should be based on students’ performance of lawyering tasks and/or their reflection on them.

* The course must *“integrate doctrine, theory, skills, and legal ethics.”*

* *Students must engage in one or more of the following professional skills:*  collaboration, conflict resolution, counseling, cross-cultural competency, document drafting, exercise of proper professional and ethical responsibility, fact development/analysis, interviewing, legal analysis, legal research, negotiation, oral communication, organization and management of legal work, policy analysis/advocacy, problem-solving, self-evaluation, trial/hearing practice, or written communication. 

* The course must *“develop the concepts underlying the professional skills being taught.”*

* Students must have *multiple opportunities to perform lawyering skills.*

* Students must have *opportunities for “self-evaluation,”* i.e. reflective self-assessment of their lawyering performances and/or role as lawyer. The aim is to guide students to interrogate their performance (from planning to execution to assessment), identifying both strengths and areas for improvement, and to enable students to compare their self-assessment with the assessment of their supervisor(s) and/or instructor(s).

# **Is your proposed course an online course, i.e., one that substitutes online teaching components for in-person classroom sessions for more than one-third of the course content?**

# 

# **No**

# 

# (Online teaching components refer to circumstances in which the student and professor are separated by time or location and the instruction occurs through use of computer technology for more than one-third of the course.  Note: online teaching, as defined here, does not include online availability of readings or other supplementary course materials.)

# 

# 

# **If yes, please complete the addendum for approval of online courses.**

# **List prerequisites or recommended courses:**

# 

# 

# 

# 

# 

# **If enrollment in this course would preclude enrollment in any overlapping courses, indicate these courses here:**

**Since 2011, courses have been required to include at least one of the following components: comparative** (providing detailed understanding of approaches in other legal systems or cultures)**; experiential** (involving students in simulated or real lawyering activities)**; problem-solving** (facilitating development of students’ problem-solving skills, rather than simply claim spotting)**; interdisciplinary** (incorporating knowledge, methods, and tools from other disciplines)**; ethics** (providing a grounded understanding of common competing tensions in the subject area and skills/mindsets for effectively resolving them)**. Please indicate which components will be incorporated into the proposed course and how you will incorporate them.**

**All of the above, to some degree.**

**Comparative: identifying, and seeking to understand, differences and similarities among how synthetic and biological intelligences approach logic and problem solving, in the context of practicing law.**

**Problem-solving: engaging actual practice management and litigation AI tools/agents to interact with the justice system and real-life practice scenarios.**

**Interdisciplinary: blending conceptual AI dimensions \- e.g., understanding what generative and agentic AI actually are and how they work \- with practical day-to-day applications, such as practice management and AI-designed or \-augmented workflows. Our aim will be to empower students with a “full-stack” understanding of the technology, as applied, so they can fully benefit from, and socially extend the benefits of, advanced digital intelligence, while simultaneously cultivating human-AI collaboration and symbiosis skills.**

**Ethics: see relevant grounding authorities, in response 4.B above.**

**List Student Learning Outcomes** (please identify the specific knowledge students will master, specific skills students will possess at the end of the course, etc.) (for more information on student learning outcomes and how to draft them, [click here](https://uch--simpplr.na96.visual.force.com/apex/Simpplr__app?u=/site/a0i41000006cgfLAAQ/page/a0c4100000gTmOBAA0)): 

**The overarching objective for this bootcamp is to instill in students how practical knowledge, open-mindedness and agility in perspective-taking and problem-solving are integral to lawyering in the intelligence age. We will aim to enable students to develop a facility with the epistemological invariants and underlying technical and real-world/digital-realm skills they will need to excel as AI continues unfolding at an accelerating rate.**

# 

# 

# **Identify which Program Learning Outcomes your course meets (**you may select more than one, **and the level of proficiency achieved**, either (I) introduced, (D) developing, or (P) proficient**):**

	**Doctrinal and Substantive Knowledge**: Students will be able to identify, explain, and 	employ basic concepts, theories, procedures, and rules of law in both core legal areas and in 	their own chosen area(s) of specialization.

(I) introduced

	**Problem Solving and Critical Thinking**: Students will be able to analyze, assess, and form 	independent judgments on a variety of legal issues, and will use these skills to solve client 	legal problems.

(D) developing

	**Practical and Communication Skills**: Students will be able to gather and analyze 	evidence, communicate effectively in appropriate written and oral formats with a 	multiplicity of audiences, and demonstrate other professional skills.

(D) developing

	**Research Skills**: Students will be able to independently retrieve, organize, analyze and 	evaluate paper and electronic legal and interdisciplinary sources, and differentiate between 	the types and relevance of the authorities.

(I) introduced

	**Professionalism**: Students will demonstrate the professional skills necessary for effective 	and ethical participation in the legal profession.

(I) introduced

	**Public Service**: Students will be able to describe the roles and responsibilities of lawyers in 	overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice.

(I) introduced   

2. **CONCENTRATIONS: AFTER CONSULTING WITH THE CONCENTRATION ADVISOR, PLEASE INDICATE WHETHER THE COURSE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A QUALIFYING ELECTIVE FOR ONE OF THE CONCENTRATIONS. THE CONCENTRATIONS (AND THE CONCENTRATION ADVISORS) ARE:**

Social Justice Lawyering (Ascanio Piomelli)

# 

# Technology & Innovation Law & Lawyering (Tal Niv)

3. **AREAS OF PRACTICE: TO AID STUDENTS IN PLANNING THEIR SEMESTER, THE COURSE CATALOG LISTS COURSES BY “AREA OF STUDY AND PRACTICE.” PLEASE INDICIATE UNDER WHICH AREAS OF PLANNING AND PRACTICE THIS COURSE SHOULD BE LISTED:**

Technology and Innovation Law & Lawyering 

4. **A BRIEF NARRATIVE TO ASSIST THE CURRICULUM COMMITTEE IN EVALUATING THE COURSE AND ITS PLACE IN THE OVERALL CURRICULUM. THE NARRATIVE SHOULD INCLUDE:**

   1. **A more detailed description of the course’s coverage, which may include a more detailed list of the topics that will be covered, a draft syllabus or course outline if available, a description of the readings (casebook or instructor-prepared) and any other information that will be helpful to the committee, including whether the course is offered at other law schools.** 

***Applied AI and the Practice of Law in the Intelligence Era (Bootcamp)*** **is a skills-intensive, practice-focused bootcamp that introduces key concepts in AI as applied to the practice of law, and prepares students to use and evaluate modern AI tools in litigation and modern law practice. Through simulations and guided labs, students perform core lawyering tasks with AI assistance—client-intake triage, document planning, drafting, verification/peer-review of AI outputs, and workflow design—while integrating doctrine, ethics, practice management skills and professional responsibility (including California Rule 1.1 competence guidance on technology). The course emphasizes conceptual and theoretical understanding, multi-agent coordination, and “AI-in-the-loop” workflows that improve quality and efficiency. Students may elect to pursue a capstone mini-project demonstrating an AI-augmented workflow or other application inspired by the bootcamp curriculum. Prior technical background is not required; optional resources are provided for interested students. This course may qualify for experiential credit (pending approval) and aligns with the Technology & Innovation Law & Lawyering and Social Justice Lawyering concentrations.**

# **Sample session-level sketch:**

* **S1 – Foundations & Ethics.**

* **S2 – Research & Drafting.**

* **S3 – Practice Ops: Intake triage, matter notes, tasking; vendor/data risk mini-audit.**

* **S4 – Litigation/Clinic Tasks: Motion/declaration shells; hallucination traps and fixes.**

* **S5 – Workflow Design: Build a small AI-augmented workflow; peer review using a rubric.**

* **S6 – Capstone & Reflection: Demo \+ risk memo; reflective self-assessment.**

**\***

**Because AI is advancing at an accelerating rate, I feel that a learning opportunity like this one necessitates agility and flexibility, with the understanding that some sudden developments in the field may require refining \- or possibly even reformulating \- portions of any given bootcamp day agenda, right up to the last minute, in order to ensure both timeliness and accuracy in the material presented.**

**I imagine we will likely be circulating emails with relevant material on a weekly basis. In terms of invariants, for instant real-world context, readings may include: materials prepared by my own Appellate Clinic’s AI helper “Aiden” in our [Substack](https://synapticjustice.substack.com/): [*Lawyers’ Monopoly and the Promises of AI*](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/BibasYLJForumEssay_wqfd4582.pdf) by Judge Stephanos Bibas; and [*Auto Clubs and the Lost Origins of the Access-to-Justice Crisis*](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/feature/auto-clubs-and-the-lost-origins-of-the-access-to-justice-crisis). Again, for technical and applied math concepts, students will be encouraged to have a look at Coursera’s AI/ML-oriented math courses and the computer science self-learning resources at [teachyourselfcs.com](http://teachyourselfcs.com). For visualizing how math comes to life in the digital realm \- which can, in turn, be helpful in understanding how gen AI works and how to optimize context and prompt engineering, accordingly \- [videos from 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) can be helpful. Additionally, by the time the course commences, I presume we will also have something akin to an AI agent that can operate like a 24/7 teaching assistant \- similar in concept, but likely more advanced, than this [Ideas Hub](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67d87884a9d0819191432b8476fa7643-appellate-clinic-ideas-hub-experimental) for the Appellate Clinic that I run here in Los Angeles.**

**More advanced students or devoted students will be encouraged to have a look at [The Nature of Computation](https://nature-of-computation.org/) by Christopher Moore and Stephan Mertens to understand the ultimate theoretical questions that implicate computers, human beings, physics, and our evolving understanding of intelligence \- from both conceptual and applied perspectives.**

**If you will indulge me: the bottom line here is that we aim to craft a course that is grounded in the practical, day-to-day skills needed to engage with AI as it continues saturating our profession and our world, yet also acknowledges we are dealing with a phenomenon likely on par with discoveries that have impacted the fate of our species and how we understand ourselves and the universe. In contrast to anything in the past that may feel conceptually similar \- like, say, the Copernican Revolution \- here we are talking about almost instantaneous worldwide adoption of a technology for which the relatively immediate applications render comparisons with history a challenge.**

2. **Your thoughts about the relationship between this course and other courses currently offered. Why is this course a necessary addition to the curriculum? Does it fill a gap in the curriculum, such as the one identified in Dean Faigman’s June 12, 2020 message to the community relating to race and racism or otherwise address such issues in the context of the material?[^1] Compared to other curricular needs of which you are aware, what priority would you assign to offering this course? If you are asked to teach this course, how would it affect your teaching schedule? Would courses you are currently teaching be dropped or picked up by other instructors?**

**As Comment 1.1 to Rule 1 (Competence) of the Rules of Professional Conduct states: “The duties set forth in this rule include the duty to keep abreast of the changes in the law and its practice, including the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology.”**

**Candidly speaking \- from the perspective of a clinical practitioner here at Public Counsel’s Appellate Clinic for Self-Represented Litigants in Los Angeles \- lawyers who lack AI proficiency are no longer competitive as volunteers with us, since AI-usage penetration now exceeds 60-70% of the layfolks we serve \- with some weeks already approaching 100%. I would anticipate similar patterns emerging among the private sector \- likely accelerated due to cost containment and profit-maximization.**

**Related to issues surrounding identity, bias in training data \- which can contaminate models’ reasoning and output \- deserves highlighting as a practical and ethical matter. Also, as startling as it may be to consider, there is a non-zero possibility that, by the time this bootcamp is offered, issues correlating with AI personhood or intelligence substrate equality may be emerging.**

3. # **In terms of scheduling, are there related courses that should not be scheduled at the same time, in order to accommodate student interest? Considering prerequisite courses and courses that may build on this course, should the course be offered in the spring or in the fall?**

# **Addendum for Approval of Online Courses**

# 

# An online course is one that substitutes online instruction for more than one-third of what would normally have been in-person class time. As indicated in the Curriculum Committee’s report for the December 4, 2020 faculty meeting: 

In general, until we have efficacy data, Academic Dean Morris Ratner recommends  a general presumption against online instruction in the following JD program classes: 1L, upper division required (bar), and foundational or building block classes. [^2]  Conversely, Dean Ratner recommends a relatively more liberal approach to approving other courses to be offered synchronously online (e.g., Certificate of Studies in Law required classes, as well as JD electives), bearing in mind the need to be cautious until we have more evidence of efficacy and the need to ensure that enough in-person electives are available to allow persons who have reached the online unit cap to complete concentrations, etc. Certain classes, including those that involve heavy use of guest lecturers, may be particularly well-suited for a distance education format that increases the pool of possible guests who can contribute without incurring travel costs. The Committee concurs with both general guidelines, though some members indicated that seminar discussions were awkward online. 

In terms of evaluating whether ABA Standards are met, proposals for synchronous online versions of courses can get a light review because synchronous instruction most closely mimics the live classroom experience and thus makes it easier to evaluate whether the credit hour requirements are met, or whether the course is sufficiently interactive. For multi-section courses taught online and synchronously, approval of a single section should be sufficient to permit synchronous online versions of any section. A key inquiry here will be the determination regarding whether the class should be offered online at all. 

Proposals for asynchronous versions of online courses require a more intensive review of the degree to which the standard set forth in the bullet points above is met. That is because it is not obvious for any asynchronous course how the standard will be met without a detailed explanation. Proponents of asynchronous courses will be advised to consult with Faculty Director of Online Legal Education, currently Abe Cable, before submitting proposals, who will share views on such courses with the Committee. 

# 

# **Bearing the foregoing in mind, please answer the following questions:**

# 

1. # **Why do you think this course is appropriate for online instruction? What are the teaching (pedagogical), scheduling, or other reasons you are seeking approval to offer this course online?**

# 

# 

# 

# 

# 

2. # **Will you replace in-person class time with synchronous content (e.g., live Zoom sessions), asynchronous content (e.g., recorded lectures or active learning tasks such as quizzes, writing assignments, and discussion boards), or a combination of synchronous and asynchronous content?**

# 

# 

# 

# 

3. # **Describe the percentage of in-person class-time that you will replace with synchronous or asynchronous online content:**

4. # **To meet credit hour requirements, an online course must replace each hour of weekly in-person class time with synchronous online sessions, recorded lectures, or active learning activities.  Describe how your course meets the credit hour requirements:** 

5. # **How will you ensure regular and substantive interaction between faculty and students and among students? In synchronous classes, typical examples include use of Socratic method, problem sets, polls, use of chat or breakout rooms, and other forms of live and direct interaction. In asynchronous classes, examples include message boards, group exercises, and assignments with feedback from the instructor.**

6. # **How will you monitor student effort and communicate with students about that effort?**

# 

# 

7. # **If this is an asynchronous course, please confirm you have consulted with Faculty Director of Online Legal Education Abe Cable about the course: Yes/No**
