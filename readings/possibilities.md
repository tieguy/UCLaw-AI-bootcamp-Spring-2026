# Possible readings
The focus of the course should be doing, not reading. But this list will be a holding pen for possible readings or supplementary materials.

* the Soul Doc, either the raw doc or a good summary like https://the-decoder.com/leaked-soul-doc-reveals-how-anthropic-programs-claudes-character/
* LLM "personalities" and cross-model comparison: https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/the-coding-personalities-of-leading-llms/ (TODO: find a law-specific equivalent on model comparison)
